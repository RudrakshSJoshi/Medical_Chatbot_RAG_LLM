      "1. Refined Wheat Flour: Refined wheat flour is made from wheat grains that have been stripped of their bran and germ, leaving only the starchy endosperm. This process removes many of the nutrients and fiber found in whole grains, and can lead to a spike in blood sugar levels. Additionally, some people may have sensitivities or allergies to wheat, which can cause digestive issues or other symptoms.\n",
      "2. Sugar: Consuming large amounts of added sugars has been linked to a variety of negative health effects, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and tooth decay.\n",
      "3. Edible Vegetable Fat; Palm Oil: Palm oil is high in saturated fats, which can increase levels of unhealthy LDL cholesterol in the blood and increase the risk of heart disease. Additionally, the production of palm oil has been linked to deforestation and habitat destruction, which can have negative impacts on the environment and wildlife.\n",
      "4. Invert Syrup: Invert syrup is a type of sweetener made from sugar that has been partially broken down into glucose and fructose. It is often used as a sweetener or preservative in processed foods. While it is not necessarily harmful in small amounts, consuming large amounts of added sugars has been linked to a variety of negative health effects.\n",
      "5. Cocoa Solids: Cocoa solids are a source of flavanols, which have been shown to have a variety of health benefits, including improved cardiovascular health and cognitive function. However, cocoa solids can also be a source of caffeine and theobromine, which can cause digestive issues or other symptoms in some people.\n",
      "6. Leavening Agents (500(i), 503(i)): These are types of leavening agents that release carbon dioxide gas when they come into contact with moisture, causing the dough or batter to rise. They are generally considered safe, but can cause digestive issues or allergic reactions in some people.\n",
      "7. Edible Salt: While salt is an essential nutrient, consuming too much can lead to high blood pressure, which can increase the risk of heart disease and stroke.\n",
      "8. Emulsifier (322): Emulsifiers are used to help mix together ingredients that would otherwise separate, such as oil and water. Emulsifiers have been linked to digestive issues and inflammation in some studies, but more research is needed to fully understand their potential health effects.\n",
      "9. Added Flavor (Nature-Identical Flavoring Substances): Nature-identical flavoring substances are synthetic compounds that are designed to mimic the taste and aroma of natural flavors. While they are generally considered safe, some people may have allergies or sensitivities to certain flavoring agents.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to note that the potential health effects of these ingredients can vary depending on the amount and frequency of consumption, as well as individual factors such as age, health status, and genetic predisposition. Additionally, it's always a good idea to consume a varied and balanced diet that includes a wide range of whole foods.\n"

      "\n",
      "In a RAG model, a retrieval component first searches a large corpus of text to find relevant documents or passages that may contain the answer to a given question. These documents are then passed to a generation component, which uses them as context to generate a response.\n",
      "\n",
      "The retrieval component can be implemented using various information retrieval techniques, such as sparse or dense vector representations of the documents, and can be combined with different ranking algorithms to select the most relevant documents. The generation component can be any type of language model, such as a sequence-to-sequence model or a transformer-based model.\n",
      "\n",
      "RAG models have several advantages over traditional language models. First, they can generate more accurate and informative responses by leveraging external knowledge beyond the training data. Second, they can adapt to new domains or topics by retrieving relevant documents from a corpus. Third, they can reduce the risk of generating hallucinated or factually incorrect information by grounding the responses in real-world documents.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, RAG models also have some limitations. For example, they require a large and diverse corpus of text to retrieve relevant documents, which can be difficult to obtain or create. Additionally, the retrieval and generation components can introduce errors or biases in the responses, which can affect the overall accuracy and fairness of the model.\n",
