# Medical Assistance Bot using RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) Architecture

This repository contains the implementation of a state-of-the-art **Medical Assistance Bot** leveraging **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) Architecture**. The bot is designed to provide **accurate, relevant, and timely information on a wide range of medical topics, enhancing patient care and supporting healthcare professionals.**

## NEW UPDATES
- **Context Classifier Chatbot**
  - **Introduction**
    - The Context Classifier Chatbot is a sophisticated chatbot designed to streamline the process of understanding and categorizing user queries. This update introduces a context stripping and identifier mechanism, significantly enhancing the chatbot's efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

  - **Key Features**
    - **Context Stripping and Identifier**
      - **Pre-segregation Layer**: The chatbot utilizes a pre-segregation layer to categorize the meaning behind user questions into specific categories. Currently, it distinguishes between nutrition and health-related queries and general queries.
      - **Selective Context Retrieval**: The chatbot retrieves context only when the query is categorized as non-general (e.g., nutrition and health-related). This reduces the need for extensive context searches for general queries, optimizing performance.

    - **Benefits**
      - **Reduced Input Costs**: By categorizing queries and selectively retrieving context, the input costs are minimized. The input size remains almost constant for segregation purposes, and context retrieval is bypassed for general queries.
      - **Time Efficiency**: With a likelihood of general queries being between 20-80%, the chatbot saves time by avoiding unnecessary similarity searches and large context additions.
      - **Cost Savings**: The reduction in input prompt size and selective context retrieval contribute to overall cost savings.

    - **How It Works**
      - **User Query Segregation**: When a user submits a query, the chatbot first processes it through a pre-segregation layer.
      - **Category Identification**: The pre-segregation layer identifies whether the query is general or related to nutrition and health.
      - **Context Retrieval**: If the query is categorized as general, the chatbot responds without additional context retrieval. If it is related to nutrition and health, the necessary context is retrieved to provide a comprehensive response.

- **Vector Database Setup**
  There are now two different databases to integrate with chatbots, using
  1. ChromaDB
  2. FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)

  - **Chroma Database Setup**
    - 384 dimensions (with `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)
    - 1024 dimensions (with `Alibaba-NLP/gte-large-en-v1.5`)
    - 4096 dimensions (with `Cohere Embeddings`)

  - **FAISS Vector Database Setup**
    - 1024 dimensions (with `Alibaba-NLP/gte-large-en-v1.5` embedding functions)
    - FAISS setup includes:
      - `.faiss` and `metadata.json` files for medical and nutrition databases in two separate folders.

  - **Common Files**
    - A common `context_retrieve.py` file is present in the `vector_database_setup` folder, which provides instructions on retrieving data and contexts from the FAISS vector database, with open prompts to allow **Chain-Of-Thought** processing.

**Important Note:**
- FAISS vector database requires a pointer to files, the metadata provides the chunk location -> (name_of_file, page_no., chunk_id), and it should be fetched manually.

Key Features:
- Utilizes **RAG architecture** to combine retrieval of relevant documents with generative capabilities.
- Provides **precise and context-aware responses** based on extensive medical knowledge.
- Supports a variety of medical queries ranging from **symptoms and conditions to treatments and medications**.
