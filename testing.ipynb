The\\ninfection is noncontagious.\\nClostridium tetani\\xa0is introduced into the body through a wound and produces a toxin whose action on the central\\nnervous system is responsible for the symptoms of tetanus.\\nTetanus is entirely preventable by vaccination. It occurs in people who have not been fully vaccinated before exposure\\nor have not received adequate post-exposure prophylaxis. In these individuals, most breaks in the skin or mucous\\nmembranes carry a risk of tetanus, but the wounds with the greatest risk are: the stump of the umbilical cord in\\nneonates, puncture wounds, wounds with tissue loss or contamination with foreign material or soil, avulsion and crush\\ninjuries, sites of non-sterile injections, chronic wounds (e.g. lower extremity ulcers), burns and bites. Surgical or\\nobstetrical procedures performed under non-sterile conditions also carry a risk of tetanus.\\nClinical features\\nGeneralised tetanus is the most frequent and severe form of the infection. It presents as muscular rigidity, which\\nprogresses rapidly to involve the entire body, and muscle spasms, which are very painful. Level of consciousness is not\\naltered.\\nChildren and adults\\nNeonates\\nTreatment\\nHospitalisation is needed and usually lasts 3 to 4 weeks. Correct management can reduce mortality even in hospitals\\nwith limited resources.\\nGeneral measuresAverage time from exposure to onset of symptoms is 7 days (3 to 21 days).\\nMuscular rigidity begins in the jaw muscles (difﬁculty with then inability to open mouth [trismus] preventing the patient\\nfrom speaking, eating), spreading to the face (ﬁxed smile), neck (difﬁculty with swallowing), to the trunk (restriction\\nof respiratory muscles; hyperextension of spine [opisthotonus]), to the abdomen (guarding) and to the limbs (ﬂexion\\nof the upper limbs and extension of the lower limbs).\\nMuscle spasms, which are very painful, appear at the onset or when muscular rigidity becomes generalised. They\\nare triggered by stimuli (noise, light, touch) or arise spontaneously. Spasms of the thoracic and laryngeal muscles\\nmay cause respiratory distress or aspiration.\\nIn 90% of cases, initial symptoms appear within 3 to 14 days of birth.\\nThe ﬁrst signs are signiﬁcant irritability and difﬁculty sucking (rigidity of the lips, trismus) then rigidity becomes\\ngeneralised, as in adults. Any neonate, who initially sucked and cried normally, presenting with irritability and difﬁculty\\nsucking 3 to 28 days after birth and demonstrating rigidity and muscle spasms should be assumed to have neonatal\\ntetanus.\\nEnsure intensive nursing care.\\nThe patient should be in a dark, quiet room.

If clinical\\nsymptoms/signs are present suggesting one of these infections, but the CD4 count is greater than or equal to 200\\ncells/mm, it is unlikely that that particular infection is present.\\nOpportunistic infectionsPrimary infection or acute retroviral syndrome: 50 to 70% of newly infected individuals develop during\\nseroconversion (from 15 days to 3 months post exposure), a viral syndrome with fever, malaise, and\\nlymphadenopathy.\\nAsymptomatic HIV infection\\xa0(after seroconversion): a period of clinical latency, but not viral latency. The time\\nperiod for progression from HIV infection to the development of severe immune deﬁciency in western countries is\\napproximately 10 years. This period appears to be shorter in developing countries.\\nSymptomatic HIV infection: with progressive destruction of the immune system, common and more severe\\ndiseases occur more frequently, and with higher mortality, in seropositive individuals.\\nAIDS: this stage corresponds to the development of severe opportunistic infections and neoplasms. From a\\nbiological point of view, AIDS is deﬁned as a CD4 count < 200 cells/mm.

CD4 count is useful for identifying severely\\nimmunosuppressed. Other tests such as blood count, tests for liver (ALAT) and renal function (creatinine clearance) are\\nnot essential, but can be useful in detecting adverse effects.\\nTreatment of opportunistic and other infections\\nWith progressive immunosuppression, HIV-infected patients who are not receiving triple therapy (or patients on ART\\nbut with poor adherence) become increasingly susceptible to infections. For conditions of clinical stages 2 and 3,\\nstandard treatments are usually effective. Patients may beneﬁt from primary prophylaxis against opportunistic\\ninfections (see\\xa0Primary prophylaxis).

Goitre can also be\\ncaused or aggravated by the regular consumption of goitrogens such as manioc, cabbage, turnips, millet etc.\\n\\xa0\\nGoitre is an adaptive process: iodine is essential for the production of thyroid hormones; iodine deﬁciency impairs\\nthyroid hormone synthesis; to compensate, the thyroid gland increases in volume. Thyroid function usually remains\\nnormal.\\n\\xa0\\nAs well as the development of goitre, iodine deﬁciency in pregnant women has serious consequences for the child\\n(foetal and perinatal mortality, physical and mental retardation, cretinism). These risks must be prevented by providing\\niodine supplementation in iodinedeﬁcient areas.\\nClinical features\\nPrevention and treatment\\nThe objective of prevention is to reduce the consequences of iodine deﬁciency in neonates and children. Supplying\\niodised salt through national programmes is the recommended method of prevention.\\n\\xa0\\nFor prevention in populations living in iodine deﬁcient areas where iodised salt is not available and for curative\\ntreatment of patients with goitre: use\\xa0iodised oil, according to national protocols. For information (according to the\\nWHO):\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nCurative and preventive single-doses are the same. Oral treatment is preferred. The target populations are pregnant\\nand breastfeeding women, women of childbearing age and children.\\n\\xa0\\nIn children, goitre disappears after several months. It disappears more slowly (or never) in adults despite restoration of\\nnormal thyroid function in 2 weeks. Surgery is only indicated for patients with local mechanical dysfunction.The WHO proposes a simpliﬁed classiﬁcation based on the signiﬁcance of goitre:\\nGroup 0: normal thyroid, no palpable or visible goitre\\nGroup 1: enlarged thyroid, palpable but not visible when the neck is in the normal position\\nGroup 2: thyroid clearly visible when the neck is in the normal position\\nPossible mechanical complications (rare): compression, deviation of the trachea or of the oesophagus.\\nPopulationIodised oil PO\\nonce yearly \\n(190 mg capsule)\\nChildren under 1 year 1 capsule\\nChildren from 1 to < 6 years 2 capsules\\nChildren from 6 to 15 years 3 capsules\\nPregnant or lactating women\\nor women of childbearing age2 capsules', metadata={'source': 'data/guideline-170-en.pdf', 'page': 388}),\n",

      "Question: I have cold extremties, pale skin, and I feel cold, what could be the problem?\n",
      "Answer: Based on the symptoms you've provided - cold extremities, pale skin, and feeling cold - it is possible that you could be experiencing symptoms of anemia. Anemia is a condition characterized by a low level of hemoglobin in the blood, which can lead to symptoms such as pallor (pale skin), fatigue, and feeling cold. However, it is important to note that these symptoms can also be caused by other medical conditions. Therefore, it is recommended that you consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Describe acute heart failure and its clinical features\n",
      "Answer: Acute heart failure, also known as acute pulmonary edema, is a sudden and life-threatening form of heart failure. It is characterized by the inability of the heart to maintain adequate cardiac output, resulting in the accumulation of fluid in the lungs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The clinical features of acute heart failure include sudden onset or exacerbation of dyspnea, fatigue, increased time to recover after exercise, bilateral peripheral edema, cold extremities, elevated jugular venous pressure, bilateral pulmonary crepitations and/or extra heart sound (gallop rhythm) on auscultation. Severe respiratory distress, such as intercostal retractions, nasal flaring, see-saw breathing, SpO2 < 90%, cyanosis, profuse sweating, and confusion may also be present. Additionally, patients may experience systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg (cardiogenic shock), rapid and excessive increase in arterial blood pressure (hypertensive emergency), heart rate (HR) > 130/minute or < 40/minute, and respiratory rate (RR) > 30/minute or < 12/minute. Chest pain may also be present if there is underlying cardiac ischemia. ECG may show signs of myocardial ischemia or arrhythmia. Chest x-ray may show signs of pulmonary edema, such as dilation of vessels in upper lobes, perihilar haze, thickening of septa, prominent opacities in hilar and perihilar regions and pleural effusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to note that the diagnosis of acute heart failure is mainly clinical, and if available, paraclinical investigations such as ECG, chest x-ray and Point of Care Ultrasound (POCUS) can be used to confirm the diagnosis. Patients with acute heart failure should be hospitalized and placed in a semi-seated position with legs down. Oxygen should be administered if SpO2 is less than 90%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is schistosomiases?\n",
      "Answer: Schistosomiases are acute or chronic visceral parasitic diseases caused by five species of trematodes (schistosomes). The three main species that infect humans are Schistosoma haematobium, Schistosoma mansoni, and Schistosoma japonicum. Schistosoma mekongi and Schistosoma intercalatum have a more limited distribution. Humans are infected while wading/bathing in fresh water infested with schistosome larvae. Symptoms occurring during the phases of parasite invasion and migration are frequently overlooked. Schistosomiasis is suspected when symptoms of established infection become evident, and each species gives rise to a specific clinical form. The severity of the disease depends on the parasite load, and children aged 5 to 15 years are particularly at risk. An antiparasitic treatment should be administered to reduce the risk of severe lesions, even if there is a likelihood of re-infection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the treatment of cellulitis??\n",
      "Answer: Based on the provided document, the treatment of cellulitis includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Administering antibiotics: The antibiotics can be administered either orally or intravenously depending on the severity of the infection.\n",
      "2. Treating the portal of entry: This involves cleaning and treating any wounds, bites, or other sources of infection in the skin.\n",
      "3. Treating comorbidities: Any underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to the infection should be identified and treated.\n",
      "4. Checking and/or catching up tetanus vaccination: If the patient has not had a recent tetanus vaccination or their vaccination status is unknown, they should receive a tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine.\n",
      "5. In case of necrotising fasciitis, septic arthritis or osteomyelitis: If the infection has progressed to these more severe conditions, urgent transfer to a surgical center and initiation of intravenous antibiotic treatment while awaiting transfer is necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, bed rest, elevation of the affected area, treatment of pain, and follow-up of the infection by outlining the area of erythema with a pen are also recommended. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be avoided as they may increase the risk of necrotising fasciitis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: I have cough, wheezing and low-grade fever, what is my diagnosis?\n",
      "Answer: Based on the symptoms you've described - cough, wheezing, and low-grade fever - it's possible that you have acute bronchitis. However, it's important to note that these symptoms could also be indicative of other respiratory conditions, such as asthma or pneumonia.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the document provided, it's mentioned that acute bronchitis is often characterized by a heavy cough that is dry at the beginning and then becomes productive, low-grade fever, no tachypnoea or dyspnoea, bronchial wheezing on pulmonary auscultation, and fever that can be managed with paracetamol.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, if you have a persistent cough, dyspnoea, increased volume of sputum, or purulent sputum, it may indicate a more serious condition such as chronic bronchitis or pneumonia.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. They may recommend further tests such as a chest X-ray or blood tests to rule out other conditions.\n",

The haberdasher appears to be uncomfortable and afraid to approach Humblesmith, repeatedly looking into the distance as if he can see Humblesmith's thoughts. Despite this, he urges Humblesmith to pay for his goods and leave. Humblesmith remains standing and looking into the distance, and then sees a four-seater sedan hit a man who resembles him and drive away.

      "Based on the context provided, Lucy is a character who used to be conflicted and has spent nine years saving her own life. Now, she is saving everyone she can, even \"crossing the line.\" Her spirit is currently directing her to save a boy with a certain sentient plant, especially from his clone sent to kill him before he turns fourteen. One of Lucy's notable abilities is harnessing and controlling invisible magnetic energy beams. She previously saved a man named Jon Watts from committing suicide by pulling him off a ledge using her energy beams. Lucy's main objective at the moment is to save Humblesmith, the boy with the sentient plant."
