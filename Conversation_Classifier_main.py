- If expected response type is health, then only refer to context, conversation history, health conversation history, rephrased question, question, to answer accurately and precisely.
- If expected response type is general, then only refer to the question, conversation history, general conversation history, rephrased question and general conversation history to answer.

                            'health' means the text talks about anything related to human body, health, biology, chemistry, biochemistry, nutrition, food, or any science related to these fields.
                            'general' means the text does not relate to health or the specified sciences and 
                            can be answered independently without context,

                            Your answer should be based on both conversations because the current conversation may be dependent on the previous conversation.

                            - By no means include both numbers in your response, you response is used to detect which number is present, which is important for further evaluation.
                            - Answer should be a number, which is either '8512' or '6781', but do not include both in the response.
